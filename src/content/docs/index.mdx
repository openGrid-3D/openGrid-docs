## What is openGrid?

**openGrid** is a general-purpose wall and desk mounting framework and ecosystem. It’s designed with a clear, opinionated structure that emphasizes:

- **Ease of use**
- **Visual simplicity**
- **Modular extensibility**

openGrid is built around a **28mm grid size**, making it **Gridfinity-compatible**, and integrates with systems like **Multiboard**, **HSW**, **GOEWS**, and standard **metric screws**. It also has first-class support for **Underware 2.0**.

All base components are designed to look clean and modern — making them *living room compatible*. But the true power of openGrid comes from its flexibility: all modeling and source files are provided, making it easy to remix and extend.

Whether you're a designer, maker, or hobbyist, openGrid is built to grow with your needs. Feedback and contributions are always welcome!

## Why Choose openGrid?

- **Designed for Modularity**: Combine and stack components as needed
- **Easy to Customize**: Built in OpenSCAD with parametric flexibility
- **Print-Ready**: Optimized for desktop 3D printers, including Bambu AMS support
- **Looks Great Anywhere**: Clean lines and minimal style, made to blend in
