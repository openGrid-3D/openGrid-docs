openGrid accessories attach to your board using the snap system, providing endless possibilities for organization and storage. The ecosystem includes both official accessories and a growing community of third-party designs.

## Core Accessories

### Mounting Hardware
- **Mounting snaps**: For attaching full boards to walls
- **Cover tiles**: Create flat surfaces over mounting points
- **Connectors**: Align and connect multiple boards

### Snap Types
- **Basic snaps**: Standard connection points for most accessories
- **Directional snaps**: Stronger hold with arrow marking for upward orientation
- **Lock snaps**: Print-in-place rotating mechanism for permanent attachment

## Compatible Systems

### Gridfinity Integration
openGrid's 28mm grid is mathematically compatible with Gridfinity's 42mm system:
- 2 Gridfinity units = 84mm
- 3 openGrid units = 84mm

This allows most Gridfinity accessories to work with openGrid boards.

### Multiconnect Support
Full compatibility with Multiconnect accessories, expanding your options significantly. Multiconnect snaps allow you to use accessories from multiple ecosystems.

### Underware Integration
Specialized cable management system that mounts directly to openGrid boards, providing clean under-desk cable routing with minimal space requirements.
