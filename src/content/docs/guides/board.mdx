## Overview

OpenGrid is a 3D-printed open board ecosystem designed as a modular framework for wall and desk organization. The system features a clean, opinionated design that balances sturdiness with ease of use, making it "living room compatible" – attractive enough to hang in any room without compromising aesthetics.

The board system uses a 28×28mm grid pattern and connects multiple squares to create larger surfaces. Everything is designed to be operated from the front side, eliminating the need to access the back once mounted.

## Board Types

### Full Board

- **Thickness**: 6.8mm
- **Grid**: 28×28mm spacing
- **Use case**: Heavy-duty applications and general mounting
- **Features**: Robust construction for holding substantial weight

### Light Board

- **Thickness**: 4mm (approximately half of full board)
- **Grid**: 28×28mm spacing
- **Use case**: Light applications and confined spaces
- **Features**: Built-in screw holes for direct wall mounting

### Prerequisites

- 3D printer capable of printing PLA/PETG
- Basic hand tools (screwdriver)
- Wall mounting hardware (screws and anchors)

### Setup Steps

1. **Print the board tiles**
   - Download STL files from printables or makerworld
   - Print settings: 0.2mm layer height, 15-20% infill  
     (see [printing instructions](/guides/printing) for more details)

2. **Connect multiple boards** (if needed)
   - Insert connector pegs into all holes on the connecting edge
   - Align boards and snap together with moderate pressure
   - Push from the front with fingers on the adjacent tile

3. **Mount to wall**
   - **Light Board**: Use built-in screw holes directly
   - **Full Board**: Insert mounting tiles, then screw through them
   - All mounting can be done from the front side

4. **Add accessories**
   - Insert snaps into grid holes
   - Snap in your accessories and storage solutions

### Verification

- Boards should sit flush against wall
- Connections between tiles should be aligned
- Snaps should click securely into place

### Next Steps

- Explore snap types (basic, directional, lock snaps)
- Check out compatible accessories (Gridfinity, Multiconnect)
- Design custom accessories using provided templates

### Troubleshooting

- **Connectors too tight**: Check print tolerances, may need slight sanding or better print slightly smaller (like 99.5%) - depending on your printer accuracy
- **Board flexing**: Add more mounting points or use full board instead of light
- **Snaps not holding**: Verify correct snap type for your application

## Board Connection System

Boards connect using small plastic pegs that insert into holes along the edges. The connection system serves primarily for alignment rather than structural support, though multiple connected boards do provide mutual reinforcement.

**Connection Process:**
1. Insert connector pegs into all holes on the edge you want to connect
2. Align the second board with the first
3. Apply moderate pressure to snap boards together
4. The grip is firm but not overly tight for easy reconfiguration

## Mounting Options

### Light Board Mounting

The light board includes integrated screw holes for direct wall attachment. This makes it ideal for quick installations and applications where you want minimal profile.

### Full Board Mounting

Full boards use separate mounting tiles that insert into the grid:
- **Standard mounting tiles**: Basic screw-through design
- **Covered mounting tiles**: Include decorative covers to hide mounting hardware for a clean appearance

All mounting operations can be performed from the front, allowing you to add additional mounting points after installation if needed.

## Design Philosophy

OpenGrid follows several key design principles:

**Living Room Compatible**: Clean aesthetics suitable for any room in the house, not just workshops or garages.

**Front-Side Access**: All operations (mounting, connecting, accessory attachment) can be done from the front without wall access.

**Material Efficiency**: Two board thicknesses optimize material usage and print time for different applications.

**Open Framework**: Designed as a platform for community development rather than a closed ecosystem.

## Gridfinity Compatibility

OpenGrid maintains compatibility with Gridfinity accessories through its 28mm grid system. While Gridfinity uses 42mm spacing, the relationship works out mathematically:
- 2 Gridfinity units = 84mm (2 x 42mm)
- 3 OpenGrid units = 84mm (3 × 28mm)

This allows existing Gridfinity accessories to be used with OpenGrid boards, though some shelves may require slight modifications due to border dimensions.
