## Overview

OpenGrid is a 3D-printed open board ecosystem designed as a modular framework for wall and desk organization. The system features a clean, opinionated design that balances sturdiness with ease of use, making it "living room compatible" – attractive enough to hang in any room without compromising aesthetics.

The board system uses a 28×28mm grid pattern and connects multiple squares to create larger surfaces. Everything is designed to be operated from the front side, eliminating the need to access the back once mounted.

## Board Types

### Full Board

- **Thickness**: 6.8mm
- **Grid**: 28×28mm spacing
- **Use case**: Heavy-duty applications and general mounting
- **Features**: Robust construction for holding substantial weight

### Light Board

- **Thickness**: 4mm (approximately half of full board)
- **Grid**: 28×28mm spacing
- **Use case**: Light applications and confined spaces
- **Features**: Built-in screw holes for direct wall mounting

### Prerequisites

- 3D printer capable of printing PLA/PETG
- Basic hand tools (screwdriver)
- Wall mounting hardware (screws and anchors)

### Setup Steps

1. **Print the board tiles**
   - Download STL files from printables or makerworld
   - Print settings: 0.2mm layer height, 15-20% infill  
     (see [printing instructions](./printing) for more details)

2. **Connect multiple boards** (if needed)
   - Insert connector pegs into all holes on the connecting edge
   - Align boards and snap together with moderate pressure
   - Push from the front with fingers on the adjacent tile

3. **Mount to wall**
   - **Light Board**: Use built-in screw holes directly
   - **Full Board**: Insert mounting tiles, then screw through them
   - All mounting can be done from the front side

4. **Add accessories**
   - Insert snaps into grid holes
   - Snap in your accessories and storage solutions

### Verification

- Boards should sit flush against wall
- Connections between tiles should be aligned
- Snaps should click securely into place

### Next Steps

- Explore snap types (basic, directional, lock snaps)
- Check out compatible accessories (Gridfinity, Multiconnect)
- Design custom accessories using provided templates

### Troubleshooting

- **Connectors too tight**: Check print tolerances, may need slight sanding or better print slightly smaller (like 99.5%) - depending on your printer accuracy
- **Board flexing**: Add more mounting points or use full board instead of light
- **Snaps not holding**: Verify correct snap type for your application

## Board Connection System

Boards connect using small plastic pegs that insert into holes along the edges. The connection system serves primarily for alignment rather than structural support, though multiple connected boards do provide mutual reinforcement.

**Connection Process:**
1. Insert connector pegs into all holes on the edge you want to connect
2. Align the second board with the first
3. Apply moderate pressure to snap boards together
4. The grip is firm but not overly tight for easy reconfiguration

## Mounting Options

### Light Board Mounting

The light board includes integrated screw holes for direct wall attachment. This makes it ideal for quick installations and applications where you want minimal profile.

### Full Board Mounting

Full boards use separate mounting tiles that insert into the grid:
- **Standard mounting tiles**: Basic screw-through design
- **Covered mounting tiles**: Include decorative covers to hide mounting hardware for a clean appearance

All mounting operations can be performed from the front, allowing you to add additional mounting points after installation if needed.

- [openGrid mounts on makerworld](https://makerworld.com/en/search/models?keyword=opengrid+mount)

**Metric Screw Integration:**
- M3 hex nut snaps for heavy-duty mounting
- Tested with 3-4kg loads successfully
- Compatible with any M3-threaded hardware
- Insert hex nut from back, screw from front

**Specialized Applications:**
- Speaker mounting (demonstrated with Sonos Roam)
- Monitor arms and heavy accessories
- Industrial equipment mounting
- Custom hardware integration

## Performance Comparison: Full vs Lite Boards

### Specifications

| Feature | Full Board | Lite Board |
|---------|------------|------------|
| **Thickness** | 6.8mm | 4mm |
| **Material Usage** | Standard | -70% vs comparable systems |
| **Load Capacity** | Heavy-duty | Light applications |
| **Mounting Method** | Mounting snaps required | Built-in screw holes |
| **Flexibility** | Rigid | Flexible but stable |
| **Print Time** | Longer | Significantly reduced |

### Use Case Recommendations

**Choose Full Board When:**
- Heavy accessories (tools, equipment, storage)
- Maximum load capacity needed
- Professional workshop environments
- Long-term permanent installations
- Multiple large accessories per board

**Choose Lite Board When:**
- Light accessories (cables, small tools, organizers)
- Space constraints (under-desk applications)
- Quick installations needed
- Material/time efficiency is priority
- Underware cable management systems

### Performance Characteristics

**Full Board Advantages:**
- Maximum structural integrity
- Handles substantial weight loads
- Professional-grade durability
- Suitable for industrial applications
- Better for multi-accessory setups

**Lite Board Advantages:**
- 70% material savings vs comparable systems
- Faster printing and installation
- Built-in mounting eliminates extra parts
- Ideal for confined spaces
- Maintains rigidity despite flexibility

### Load Testing Results

**Full Board:**
- Tested with heavy workshop tools
- Supports multiple large accessories simultaneously
- No flexing under normal loads
- Suitable for permanent installations

**Lite Board:**
- Tested with 3-4kg loads successfully (using M3 hardware)
- Maintains stability for light-medium applications
- Some flexibility under load but remains functional
- Perfect for cable management and light storage

### Material Efficiency

Both board types offer significant material savings compared to traditional systems:
- **Lite Board**: 70% less material than comparable solutions
- **Full Board**: 30% less material than comparable solutions
- Reduced print time translates to lower energy costs
- Less material waste supports sustainable making

### Selection Guidelines

**For New Users:**
- Start with lite board for most applications
- Upgrade to full board only when load requirements demand it
- Test both types if uncertain about requirements

**For Specific Applications:**
- **Underware systems**: Always use lite board for space efficiency
- **Tool walls**: Full board recommended for heavy tools
- **Living spaces**: Either works, choose based on load needs
- **Workshops**: Full board for primary storage, lite for accessories

## Gridfinity Compatibility

OpenGrid maintains compatibility with Gridfinity accessories through its 28mm grid system. While Gridfinity uses 42mm spacing, the relationship works out mathematically:
- 2 Gridfinity units = 84mm (2 x 42mm)
- 3 OpenGrid units = 84mm (3 × 28mm)

This allows existing Gridfinity accessories to be used with OpenGrid boards, though some shelves may require slight modifications due to border dimensions.
