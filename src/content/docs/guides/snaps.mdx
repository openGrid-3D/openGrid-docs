description: Overview of different snaps.

The snap system is the foundation of OpenGrid - these are the connection points that attach accessories to your board. Snaps slide into the board's 28mm grid holes and hold your accessories securely in place.

## Board Compatibility

OpenGrid supports two board types:

**Full Board (6.8mm thick)** - Works with all full-thickness snaps and requires mounting snaps for wall attachment. Best for heavy-duty applications.

**Lite Board (4mm thick)** - Uses lite versions of snaps (3.4mm thick) and has built-in screw holes for direct mounting. Ideal for lightweight applications and space-saving.

See the [board documentation](/guides/board) for more details on the board.

# Types

## Mounting Snap

Specifically designed for attaching your OpenGrid board to walls or surfaces using countersunk screws. Required only for full-thickness boards, while lite boards have built-in screw holes. Still you can also add mounting snaps to your lite board if necessary.

**When to use:** For mounting full boards to walls or when additional support points are needed.

**Installation:** Push into grid hole, insert screw through center, and attach to wall.

## Generic Snap variants

### Normal Snap

Normal snaps that can be pushed into your board for attaching accessories.

**When to use:** For Normal accessory usage.

**Installation:** Push the snap into the board.

### Directional Snap

A stronger version of the bare snap that locks in one direction. Features three flexible sides and one rigid side marked with an arrow pointing upward.

**When to use:** For accessories that need extra holding strength or face directional forces.

**Installation:** Push the arrow-marked side in first (upper part), then snap the lower part into place. The upper part won't move out easily when force is applied from behind.

**Removal:** Rotate the lower part of the snap out of the board, so the lower edge is free, then remove rest of the snap.

### Lock Snap

A print-in-place snap with a rotating mechanism that locks firmly into the board. Features a coin slot on top for easy rotation and visual indication of lock status. The lock snap provides a rigid snap - similar to the directional snap - but without any directional constraints. So it is also very much suitable for under desk or similar use cases.

**When to use:** For heavy accessories or when you need maximum holding strength without directional bias.

**How it works:** 
- Insert like any other snap when in open position
- Rotate the inner mechanism using the coin slot to lock in place
- The snap expands outward, gripping the board tightly
- Rotate back to unlock and remove

**Installation:** Push into grid hole while in open position, then rotate inner mechanism to lock.

**Removal:** Rotate inner mechanism to unlock position, then remove normally.

### Bare Snap

The basic building block for creating your own accessories. These simple snaps provide a foundation for custom designs. Those snaps are not meant for printing, but as the base for modeling.

**When to use:** As the base for custom designs. The base snaps are provided for all snap options like normal, directional and lock snaps for the lite and full board - use whatever suits your needs best.

**Installation:** Simply push into board's grid holes until they click into place.

### Metric Screw Snap

Allows you to use metric screws to attach accessories to your openGrid board.

**Available versions:** Normal and Directional Snap.

**When to use:** Use whenever you want to connect anything using metric screws. This opens up the ability for any existing accessory or device.

### Multiboard Snaps

Creates compatibility with the multiboard system.

**Note:** This allows you to add multiboard connection points to openGrid, having those will be completely sufficient for single snap applications. If you want to use mode that one grid tile for attachment the different grid sizes (28mm vs. 25mm) will create additional challenges. There are also models out there to mitigate this grid difference.

**Available versions:** Normal and Directional Snap.

**When to use:** Use to attach your existing multiboard accessories.

### Honeycomb Storage Wall (HSW) Snaps

Creates compatibility with the Honeycomb Storage Wall (HSW).

**Note:** The Honeycomb Storage Wall (HSW) had a board thickness of 8mm compared to the 6.8mm thickness that openGrid uses. As of this the HSW snaps will be slightly offset from the board surface. In addition the HSW uses a different grid size, so if you need to use multiple tiles keep this misalignment in mind.

**Available versions:** Normal Snap.

**When to use:** Use to attach your existing HSW accessories.

### GOEWS Snaps

Creates compatibility with the GOEWS system.

**Available versions:** Normal and Directional Snap.

**When to use:** Use to attach your existing GOEWS accessories.
