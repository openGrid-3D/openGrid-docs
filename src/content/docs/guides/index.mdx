## Goals

openGrid provides an opinionated, yet flexible, grid-based system for mounting things to surfaces. The goals for this system are:

* **Living Room Compatibility**: The system integrates well within a variety of settings, not just a garage wall. openGrid was specifically designed to be attractive enough for any room in the house, moving beyond the industrial aesthetic of traditional workshop solutions.

* **Robust Core Parts**: Provide a focused set of essential components, so less time is spent deciding between options and more time is spent actually mounting and organizing things.

* **Material Efficiency**: Use significantly less filament than comparable frameworks (-70% for lite board, -30% for full board compared to similar solutions). This reduces both print time and material costs while maintaining functionality.

* **Universal Compatibility**: Incorporate and interoperate with other existing frameworks easily (e.g. Gridfinity, Multiconnect, and Underware). Rather than creating another isolated ecosystem, openGrid serves as a bridge between systems.

* **Open Development**: Be open and allow people to extend things (core files are released using the [CC-BY open license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)). The system is designed as a platform for community development rather than a closed product.

* **Front-Side Access**: All operations (mounting, connecting, accessory attachment) can be performed from the front without requiring access to the back of the board once mounted.

* **Space Optimization**: Eliminate wasted space in mounting systems. For example, traditional Underware setups waste approximately 1cm of vertical space that openGrid recovers for actual cable routing.

Some common use cases for openGrid are:
- Tool wall organization
- Under-desk cable routing
- 3D printer accessory mounting
- Modular workbench systems
- Custom connector experiments

and much, much more!

## The Basics

Before you start, here's a few essential details that will help you along the way.

openGrid begins with a grid of 28mm spaces called a **Board**. The size of the board can vary and is determined by you; multiple boards can be connected and composed, allowing your setup to grow as needed. See the [Boards](./board) page for more info.

Within the spaces of a board, you can attach **Snaps**. Snaps are the key building block for attaching boards to surfaces, and attaching things to boards. Attachments might snap directly into a board, or you might use a Multiconnect snap, opening the way to a large ecosystem of already tried and trusted attachments. See the [Snaps](./snaps) page for more info.
