## Goals

openGrid provides an opinionated, yet flexible, grid-based system for mounting things to surfaces. The goals for this system are:

* attain Living Room Compatibility, where the system integrates well within a variety of settings, not just a garage wall
* provide a robust set of core parts, so that less time is spent deciding on one part over another, and more time is spent actually mounting things
* use less filament than comparable frameworks (-70% for lite board, -30% for full board - compared to similar solutions)
* incorporate and interopt with other existing frameworks easily (e.g. Gridfinity, Multiconnect, and Underware)
* be open and allow people to extend things (core files are relased using the [CC-BY open license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/))

Some common use cases for openGrid are:
- Tool wall organization
- Under-desk cable routing
- 3D printer accessory mounting
- Modular workbench systems
- Custom connector experiments

and much, much more!

## The Basics

Before you start, here's a few essential details that will help you along the way.

openGrid begins with a grid of 28mm spaces called a **Board**. The size of the board can vary and is determined by you; multiple boards can be connected and composed, allowing your setup to grow as needed. See the [Boards](./board) page for more info.

Within the spaces of a board, you can attach **Snaps**. Snaps are the key building block for attaching boards to surfaces, and attaching things to boards. Attachments might snap directly into a board, or you might use a Multiconnect snap, opening the way to a large ecosystem of already tried and trusted attachments. See the [Snaps](./snaps) page for more info.
