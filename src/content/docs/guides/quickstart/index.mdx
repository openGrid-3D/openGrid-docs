openGrid can be mounted up against your wall or under your desk or anywhere you want in just a bit. This
guide is meant to help you get up and running as fast as possible.

## Choosing the board version and size

openGrid comes in two main versions:
* The full board meant to be as generic as possible
* The lite board for more lightweight applications

Choosing the version is the first crucial step to get your board up and running. Normally I would suggest
the lite board mainly for those use cases you have only little space or you won'T attach any heavy things
onto your board (although even the lite version can handle some weight). The lite version also allows you
to save some filament and time while printing.

**If in doubt use the full version.**

The next choice you will have to make is about the board size.

My recommendation would be to use the biggest size that fits your printer basically. Then measure how much
space you have on your wall or under your desk and calculate how many of those boards you need. You may also
add smaller boards on the edges to completely fill the available space.

## Mounting your board

Mounting depends a little bit on what board version you used. In general:

* The **lite board already has screw holes included**, use those for mounting with some countersunk screws
* The **full board** needs to be mounted using **mounting snaps**, this will be described in the following  
  <small>(Hint: You may also create full openGrid boards with screw holes using
  [the generator](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1304337-opengrid-tile-generator), but this is not the
  default and thus not the focus of this guide)</small>

Using the mounting snaps in general is pretty easy. Just snap those into your board and use a countersunk
screw to attach it firmly to your wall or similar.

## Connecting your board

You may want to use connectors to align your boards. Those will also ensure you can mount the whole board as
one piece. My suggestion would be to print a connector for each hole, then snap the boards together.

## Repeat until you have the full board mounted

You may add additional connectors while the first boards are already mounted to yoour wall or any other surface - or
connect multiple boards and then mount those as one piece. Both works fine.

Normally you use a mounting snap on each corner of your used boards. But you may also skip most of the mounting
snaps if you are using the normal connector on each slot. You may still add additional mounting snaps later if
necessary, as those can just be added from the front.

## Accessories

When you have completely mounted your boards it is time to add some accessories. Which accessories are
best suited depends on your setup and use use. The quickstart will continue with two variants:

* For wall mounted setups [add Multiconnect based Gridfinity shelves](./multiconnect/)
* For under desk setups [add Underware channels](./underware/)

For a generic overview of accessories continue to the [accessories page](../accessories/).
