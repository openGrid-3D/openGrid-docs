## Board Connection Issues

### Connectors Too Tight
**Problem**: Difficulty connecting boards with connector pegs
**Solutions**:
- Check print tolerances and calibration
- Light sanding of connector pegs if needed
- Print at 99.5% scale if your printer runs large
- Ensure proper layer adhesion during printing

### Board Flexing
**Problem**: Board bends or flexes under load
**Solutions**:
- Add more mounting points
- Switch from lite board to full board for heavy applications
- Ensure proper wall anchoring
- Distribute weight across multiple grid points

## Snap and Accessory Issues

### Snaps Not Holding
**Problem**: Accessories fall off or don't stay secure
**Solutions**:
- Verify correct snap type for your application
- Use directional snaps for better holding power
- Consider lock snaps for permanent installations
- Check that snap is fully inserted into grid hole

### Difficult Snap Removal
**Problem**: Can't remove snaps or tiles easily
**Solutions**:
- Use flat-head screwdriver technique (insert on side, push outward)
- For cover tiles, access from edges where possible
- Apply gentle, steady pressure rather than force
- Ensure you're pushing from the flexible side of directional snaps

## Cable Management Issues

### Rigid Cables Won't Fit in Curved Channels
**Problem**: Stiff cables difficult to route through rounded Underware channels
**Solutions**:
- Use straight channel versions for rigid cables
- Pre-bend cables before installation
- Consider larger channel sizes for thick cable bundles
- Use open channel concept for cables that need to exit mid-run

### Cables Keep Falling Out
**Problem**: Cables don't stay in Underware channels
**Solutions**:
- Use zip tie attachment points on special tiles
- Route cables through multiple attachment points
- Consider closed channel designs for loose cables
- Ensure proper channel sizing for your cable diameter

## Print Quality Issues

### Poor Surface Finish
**Problem**: Rough or inconsistent print quality
**Solutions**:
- Use 0.2mm layer height for optimal balance
- 15-20% infill is sufficient for most applications
- Ensure proper bed adhesion and temperature settings
- Check for proper cooling during bridging sections

### Dimensional Accuracy Problems
**Problem**: Parts don't fit together properly
**Solutions**:
- Calibrate printer for dimensional accuracy
- Check belt tension and mechanical issues
- Verify correct filament diameter settings
- Consider printing test pieces to verify tolerances

## Installation Issues

### Wall Mounting Problems
**Problem**: Board doesn't sit flush or secure on wall
**Solutions**:
- Use appropriate wall anchors for your wall type
- Ensure mounting snaps are fully inserted before screwing
- Check wall flatness - shim if necessary
- For lite boards, use built-in screw holes for direct mounting

### Accessories Don't Align
**Problem**: Gridfinity or other accessories don't line up properly
**Solutions**:
- Verify 28mm grid spacing is correct
- Check that accessories are designed for proper grid relationship
- Some accessories may need slight modification for border clearance
- Ensure board is properly square during installation

## Material and Compatibility Issues

### Incompatible Accessories
**Problem**: Existing accessories don't work with openGrid
**Solutions**:
- Use multiconnect snaps as universal adapters
- Check community remixes for openGrid versions
- Consider designing custom adapters
- Verify grid size compatibility (28mm for openGrid)
