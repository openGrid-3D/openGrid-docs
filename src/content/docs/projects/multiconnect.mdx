Multiconnect is openGrid's universal connection system that allows you to attach accessories and integrate with existing modular wall systems. It serves as a bridge between different organizational systems, letting you reuse accessories across multiple platforms while maintaining compatibility with your current setup.

All Multiconnect snaps feature a threaded hole in the center to allow for secure mounting and easy removal. The snap system is designed to work seamlessly across different modular wall systems while maintaining the strength and reliability needed for everyday use.
