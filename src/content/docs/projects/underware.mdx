## Overview

Underware for openGrid is a cable management system that provides clean, efficient under-desk cable routing. The openGrid version addresses space efficiency issues found in traditional Underware setups while maintaining full compatibility with the Underware ecosystem.

## Space Efficiency Benefits

Traditional Underware systems require:
- 6.4mm thick multiboard base
- Additional channel base thickness
- **Total: ~1cm of wasted space** before cables have room

openGrid Underware eliminates this waste by:
- Snapping channels directly to the board
- Using the board itself as the mounting surface
- **Saving approximately 1cm of vertical space**

This makes openGrid Underware ideal for tight spaces under desks where every millimeter counts.

## Channel Types

### Basic Channels
- **Straight channels**: Standard cable routing, works with all cable types
- **Curved channels**: Rounded profile for softer cables, more aesthetic appeal
- **L-channels**: Corner routing and direction changes

### Specialized Channels
- **T-channels**: Junction points for multiple cable runs
- **Row-change channels**: Move cables between different levels
- **Various sizes**: Different widths to accommodate cable bundles

## Installation

1. **Mount openGrid Lite board** under your desk using built-in screw holes
2. **Snap Underware channels** directly into board grid holes
3. **Route cables** through the channel system
4. **Add/remove channels** as needed - all accessible from the front

## Cable Compatibility

**Soft cables**: Work well with both straight and curved channels
**Rigid cables**: Use straight channels for easier installation and better fit

## Generator Support

Full compatibility with Andy's (Blackjack Duck) Underware generator:
- Change grid size to 28mm for openGrid compatibility
- All other settings work as normal
- Generates channels optimized for your specific setup
