[TinyRack](https://tinyrack.io) is an open, modular mini server rack compatible with the openGrid ecosystem. The TinyRack’s device mounting platform is based on multiples of openGrid’s 28 mm grid size.

With the TinyRack-openGrid adapter, you can mount openGrid grids on top of the TinyRack’s notched posts. This allows the openGrid ecosystem to expand vertically.

The cable management modules from Underware 2.0 (designed for openGrid) can also be used to manage mini-server cables in TinyRack.
The author is currently developing additional modules, such as Ethernet patch panels, to mount on openGrid.
