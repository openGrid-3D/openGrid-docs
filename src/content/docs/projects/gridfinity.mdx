title: Gridfinity Integration
description: How openGrid works with the Gridfinity ecosystem.
---

## Overview

Gridfinity is a popular modular storage system created by Zack Freedman that uses a 42mm grid pattern. openGrid provides excellent compatibility with Gridfinity through mathematical grid relationships and dedicated shelving solutions.

## Grid Compatibility

The mathematical relationship between openGrid and Gridfinity grids enables seamless integration:

- **2 Gridfinity units** = 84mm (2 × 42mm)
- **3 openGrid units** = 84mm (3 × 28mm)

This 2:3 ratio means that Gridfinity accessories designed for 2×2, 4×2, or other even dimensions will align perfectly with openGrid's 3×3, 6×3, etc. grid positions.

## Integration Methods

### Direct Compatibility
Many Gridfinity accessories work directly with openGrid boards:
- Storage bins and containers
- Tool holders and organizers
- Custom accessories from the community
- Most accessories require no modification
