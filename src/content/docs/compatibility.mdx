description: How to use existing board systems and accessories with openGrid.
---

openGrid is designed to work with existing mounting systems and accessories, allowing you to leverage your current investments while gaining the benefits of the openGrid ecosystem.

## Multiboard Integration

### Full Compatibility
openGrid's larger 28mm grid provides enough space to accommodate full multiboard tiles:

- **Full multiboard tiles**: Snap directly into openGrid holes
- **Multiconnect accessories**: Work without modification
- **Screw sizes**: All standard multiboard screws (small, mid, full) fit
- **Push-fit connectors**: Direct compatibility

### Limitations
- **Multi-tile accessories**: 28mm spacing vs multiboard's spacing may cause alignment issues
- **Single-tile applications**: Work perfectly without modification

## HSW (Honeycomb Storage Wall)

HSW accessories can be adapted to openGrid:

- **Thickness difference**: HSW is thicker than openGrid, causing slight protrusion
- **Functionality**: Full functionality maintained despite thickness mismatch
- **Use case**: Suitable for workshop environments where aesthetics are less critical

## GOEWS Integration

GOEWS uses Gridfinity grid sizing, making it compatible through the mathematical relationship:

- **Grid relationship**: 2 Gridfinity units = 3 openGrid units = 84mm
- **Directional snaps**: Use GOEWS-specific directional snaps for proper attachment
- **Strength**: Maintains GOEWS system strength benefits
- **Installation**: Push snap in tilted, then it locks in place

## Gridfinity Compatibility

### Mathematical Compatibility
The grid systems align mathematically:
- **2 Gridfinity units**: 84mm (2 × 42mm)
- **3 openGrid units**: 84mm (3 × 28mm)

### Practical Use
- **Most accessories**: Work with minimal or no modification
- **Border clearance**: Some accessories may need slight modification for proper fit
- **Shelving**: Gridfinity shelves integrate well with openGrid boards

## Metric Screw Integration

### M3 Hex Nut System
Standard metric hardware can be used with specialized snaps:

- **M3 hex nut snaps**: Accept standard M3 hex nuts on the back
- **Load capacity**: Tested with 3-4kg loads successfully
- **Applications**: Heavy accessories, speakers, monitors
- **Installation**: Insert hex nut from back, screw from front

### Benefits
- **Universal compatibility**: Works with any M3-threaded accessory
- **Strength**: Distributes load through metal hardware
- **Flexibility**: Accommodates non-3D printed accessories

## Underware 2.0 Integration

### Grid Size Modification
- **Change grid size**: Set to 28mm in Underware generators
- **Full compatibility**: All Underware features work unchanged
- **Space efficiency**: Eliminates base channel material waste

### Channel Types
All standard Underware channels work:
- Straight and curved channels
- L-channels and T-junctions
- Custom generated sizes

## Implementation Tips

### Single vs Multi-Tile Accessories
- **Single-tile**: Usually work without modification
- **Multi-tile**: May require spacing adjustments or custom adapters

### Adapter Strategy
- **Multiconnect snaps**: Universal solution for most systems
- **System-specific snaps**: Available for major systems (GOEWS, metric screws)
- **Custom adapters**: Design your own for unique requirements

### Load Considerations
- **Light accessories**: Any snap type works
- **Heavy accessories**: Use directional or lock snaps
- **Very heavy items**: Consider metric screw integration

## Community Resources

The openGrid community continues to develop adapters and compatibility solutions:

- **Printables**: Search "openGrid compatibility" or "openGrid adapter"
- **MakerWorld**: Growing collection of system adapters
- **Multiconnect ecosystem**: Extensive accessory library

This compatibility approach allows you to transition gradually to openGrid while maintaining use of existing accessories and investments.
