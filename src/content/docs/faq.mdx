## Why create openGrid when other board systems exist?

The development of openGrid was motivated by three main issues with existing systems:

1. **Material efficiency**: Traditional Underware setups require significant material and print time for base channels that don't directly contribute to cable management
2. **Living room compatibility**: Existing solutions often look industrial - openGrid was designed to be attractive enough for any room in the house
3. **Gridfinity compatibility**: While multiconnect exists for other boards, the dimensional mismatch made Gridfinity accessories look awkward on traditional grid systems

openGrid addresses these by allowing direct snap-on accessories, clean aesthetics, and proper mathematical compatibility with Gridfinity (2 Gridfinity units = 3 openGrid units = 84mm).

## What's the license for openGrid?

openGrid is released under **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY)**, which allows both commercial and non-commercial use. The license was changed from the initial non-commercial version to encourage broader adoption and ecosystem development.

You only need to provide attribution when using or modifying openGrid designs.

## How do I attach accessories to openGrid?

openGrid uses a snap system with several options:

- **Direct accessories**: Many accessories snap directly into the 28mm grid holes
- **Multiconnect compatibility**: Use multiconnect snaps to access a large ecosystem of existing accessories
- **Gridfinity compatibility**: The mathematical relationship allows most Gridfinity accessories to work with openGrid
- **Community accessories**: Growing collection of openGrid-specific designs on Printables and MakerWorld

## How do I remove snaps and tiles?

While snaps can be removed by hand, using a flat-head screwdriver makes it much easier:

1. Insert the screwdriver on the side of the snap
2. Gently push outward to pop the snap out
3. For tiles with accessible edges, you can also push from underneath

## Which board version should I use?

**Full Board (6.8mm thick)**:
- Heavy-duty applications
- Maximum load capacity
- Requires mounting snaps for wall attachment

**Lite Board (4mm thick)**:
- Light applications and space-constrained areas
- Built-in screw holes for direct mounting
- Uses approximately 70% less material than comparable systems

## Can I use existing accessories from other systems?

Yes! openGrid is designed for compatibility:

- **Multiboard, HSW, GOEWS**: Use multiconnect snaps as adapters
- **Gridfinity**: Direct compatibility due to mathematical grid relationship
- **Metric screws**: Standard mounting options available
- **Underware**: Full compatibility with modified grid size (28mm)

## How do I connect multiple boards?

1. Insert connector pegs into all holes along the edge you want to connect
2. Align the second board with the first
3. Apply moderate pressure to snap boards together
4. The connection provides alignment and light structural support

The grip is firm but not overly tight, allowing for easy reconfiguration when needed.
